An h1 header
============

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line?

*Italic*, **bold**, `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

> Block quotes are
> written like so.

> Unless I am very mistaken,
> this is working.




An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~
