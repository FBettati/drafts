Working drafts of articles for final project

For more information see http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu.

## Basic site plan

- `splash_page.md` will be the first page viewers see, introducing them to the site's goals and major questions
- `closereading.md` will be our essay providing a close reading of the primary sources we have collected with an eye towards answering our questions
- `textanalysis.md` will be the essay produced by the Text Analysis team focused on *comparing* Texas ads with other states, either as a whole or over time
- `connections.md` will be the essay produced by the team focusing on showing *connections* between Texas and surrounding states measured by mentions of named locations in different corpora
- `conclusions.md` will be a final reflection page that we will write together at the very end

## Markdown resources

- [Mastering Markdown](http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/) on GitHub-flavored Markdown
- [Dingus](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/dingus), a sandbox for testing Markdown syntax
- For the curious, [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/), a free program that can actually convert Markdown files into a variety of other file formats, including Microsoft Word files, PDF documents, and standalone HTML websites.
